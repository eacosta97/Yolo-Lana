        <p style="font-size: 40px">What is this game called "Vindinium"?</p>
        <p style="font-size: 30px">The game Vindinium is an AI game, that is designed for you to create your own bot and to design him and give him the abilities to do whatever you want them to do. The attributes that your bot are given depend on you, wheter you want to make him an all out attack bot or a field dominant bot.</p>

    <h1 style="font-size: 40px">Playing Vindinium</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 30px">When my classmates and I started to play vindinium it was all for fun, since we didn't relly now how to make our bots dominate other bots. However as we began to learn more about the bots and the coding vindinium became a more competitive game since we had our own server which had our own leaderbords.</p>

    <h1 style="font-size: 40px; text-align: center">My bot on Vindinium</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 30px">My bot got some very specific yet not so difficult, my bot likes to go for the mines which are gold makers in the game. This way my bot will pretty much only attack the mines and this I will be able to win faster since my bot is only earning a lot of gold. My code was pretty easy to make: var task;
        if(bot.yourBot.life < 25){
            task = "tavern";
        }
        else{
            task = "wantedmines";
        } 
        this code makes my bot go for tavern only if his health is lower than 25 percent, otherwise he will attack the mines and get moeny in order for my bot to win.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 30px"> if(task === "tavern") {
            var closestTavern = bot.taverns[0];
            for(i = 0; i < bot.taverns.length; i++) {
                if(bot.findDistance(myPos, closestTavern) > bot.findDistance(myPos, bot.taverns[i])) {
                    closestTavern = bot.taverns[i];</p>
