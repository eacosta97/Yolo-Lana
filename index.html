    <p style="font-size: 20px">What does HTML mean?</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. Which is the text that we use in order to make webpages and browsing pages.

    <p style="font-size: 20px">What is CSS?</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, which is a stye sheet langugage used for describing the look of a document. It basically give the document looks for it, for example animations and such, for example an image changing colors or an image flipping. Hover your mouse over the picture and you will see what I am sayin.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px">What are tags?</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">Tags are basically layouts for how you want the website to look like, for example there is a use of html tags in order to signal that there is a webpage starting. The way to write tags is to use the symbols <> and put words inside them such as p for making a new paragraph. There many things that can go wrong with tags and those errors are called syntax errors and you must go through every bit of the code in order to find the mistake that is messing up the coding.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px">What are attributes? How do you change attributes? What are some examples?</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">Attributes are the different types of characteristics you give to make your page different, such as change font size or change the background color of your page. Also, changing the font style of your page, or also you can change the size of a picture or anything else you could think of. In order to change the attributes of the your webpage you must be able to know the tags that you need type into your html file. There are many different types of tags to change the attributes of your webpages, for  example font-size: 20px is to change the font size of your page. Another exmple is changing a word to either bold or italics by either using i before the word and after it or putting strong before and after the word.</p>

    <div style="border: dashed green 10px">
      <ol>
        <ul style="font-size: 20px">4 Types Of Tags:</ul>
          <li style="font-size: 20px">p</li>
          <li style="font-size: 20px">img</li>
          <li style="font-size: 20px">html</li>
          <li style="font-size: 20px">h1</li>
      </ol>
    <ul>
      <li style="font-size: 20px">The first tag is p and it goes between <> those symbols. It is to show html that it is a new paragraph that you are typing.</li>
      <li style="font-size: 20px">The second tag is img and it also goes inside the symbols, except with this one you must put src after the img and then = and after that you put a set of quotation marks and in between the quotation marks you put the image link.</li>
      <li style="font-size: 20px">The third is html and it is by far one of the most important tags there could be in coding, due to the fact that it tells the file that you are starting a html file which is then tranfered into a website or a webpage.</li>
      <li style="font-size: 20px">The last one is h1 and it basically stands for heading, which is similar to a title for the page that is on the very top of the page. It is different from the tag named title, due to the  fact that the title tag applies to the words that will appaear on the tab of the webpage itself.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul style="font-size: 20px">Examples:
      <li style="font-size: 20px">Example for the first one would be to have a tag that is something like this < p > and then you would basically type in there whatever you want to type aftert the symbol and you would end the sentence like this < /p > and that would basically be a paragraph made and you would keep going making more paragraphs that way.</li>
      <li style="font-size: 20px">An example for the second one will be how to put the image in your page, which would look something like this < img src="link to the picture" /> and after you put that there should be a picture wherever you put your image if it is under a < p > tag it will be under that paragraph.</li>
      <li style="font-size: 20px">An example of html would be the most important thing you must have in order to have a website, and it would be to have this at the very top of the page right after another important tag that is < !DOCTYPE html > under that you must put < html >. And that signals to the html document you are about to start up on a webpage, and at the very ending you would put < /html >.</li>
      <li style="font-size: 20px">H1 is basically giving the pag a title so what you would do be to put this < hi >"title of the page"< h1 >. This will give the page a title and this is also the biggest font size you could give a page.</li>
    </ul>
