    <p style="font-size: 20px">What is the mother board, and what does it do?</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">The motherboard is a printed cicuit board that contains the principal components of a device, in this case a computer. It basically allows everything within the computer, to be able to communicate and get the computer to work. It is basicallt what gets the computer going due to the fact that it tells all the parts of the computer when to turn off and what must be getting used while the computer is on. It is sort off like a brain in a human body sending siganls to all the organs in our body.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px">What is the CPU, and what does it do?</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">The CPU is an abbreviation for central processing unit. And pretty much what it is, is pretty much a processor. YOu can also call this the brain of the computer, which means that the CPU's job is to send signals throughout the computer in telling each part what to do and how to work to satisfy the users needs and petitions. This is by far one of the most important parts in the computer due to the fact that it performs output and input operations, which are pretty much the only things computer do.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px">What is a RAM, and what is its purpose?</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">Also known as random acess memory, allows for information to be stored within the computer. It requires power in order to actually save, if the computer lost its source of power then all the data contained in the memory would be lost. Due to the fact that the information is randomly in a known place the computer can read and find the information a lot more faster than if the information was stored in the hard drive or a CD.</p>
